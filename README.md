# Dependencies for Kiwi Browser

See main repository in kiwibrowser/src

Pre-packaged dependencies used to build Kiwi Browser for Android (mirror of Google CIPD)

Use with git clone https://github.com/kiwibrowser/dependencies.git .cipd
in ~/chromium/

You can also use official Google CIPD mirror, however, it is simpler to use the pre-packaged ones
